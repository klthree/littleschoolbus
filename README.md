# littleschoolbus
picoctf 2017 challenge

This is my solution to the littleschoolbus challenge of picoctf 2017. Extractor will iterate over the files in a bmp file,
combine the least significant bits from each byte, and convert them to characters. When littleschoolbus.bmp is submitted for
evaluation the flag appears at the beginning of the resulting text.
